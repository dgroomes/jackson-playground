# jackson-playground

ðŸ“š Learning and exploring Jackson <https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson>.

## Description

This project explores the Jackson (<https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson>) umbrella of serialization/deserialization
libraries which are often a core component of a Java application that deals with JSON. For example, it illustrates how
to use the new `Records` Java language feature <https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/359> with Jackson (spoiler: starting with
Jackson version 2.12 it "just works").

A number of Jackson projects are included in this project as Git submodules because we want to use the latest "edge
version" of Jackson to get the latest and greatest features. After all, a "ðŸ“š Learning and exploring" repository is
often about learning _new_ things! These Jackson projects must be built locally and saved to your local maven
repository (a.k.a the `.m2/`directory or `mavenLocal()` in Gradle terminology). Instructions to build these projects
are in [Instructions](#instructions).

## Instructions

NOTE: I am using macOS and Bash 5.x

1. Switch to Java 11
1. Build the "edge version" of the Jackson artifacts with `./build-jackson-artifacts.sh`
1. Switch to Java 15
1. Build the project and execute the tests with `./gradlew build`
1. (Optional) If the tests had previously run and passed and no source code has changed then Gradle might choose to skip
   your tests when you would otherwise prefer to actually have your tests execute. Force Gradle to run the tests by
   executing `./gradlew cleanTest` and then running your tests with `./gradlew build` or `./gradlew test`.

## WishList

General clean ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* DONE Use Jackson's CSV support for serializing
* IN PROGRESS Use Jackson's CSV support for deserializing
* DONE Experiment with serializing from Records to a string, not just deserializing from a string into Records
* DONE Migrate to Gradle's Kotlin DSL (use <https://github.com/dgroomes/gradle-playground> as reference)
* DONE Generate "Points" (x,y) in the test data generation script instead of the arbitrary "DummyType" type
